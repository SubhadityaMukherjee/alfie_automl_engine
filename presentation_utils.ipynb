Consider increasing the visibility of these indicators. **Code Suggestion**: ```css .ast-menu-toggle:focus, .button.search-submit:focus, input:focus { outline: 3px solid #046BD2; /* A more visible focus indicator */ } ``` 3. **Color Contrast**: Ensure that the foreground and background color combinations meet WCAG color contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text). **Code Suggestion**: Review color variables, such as `var(--ast-form-field-color)` and ensure their contrast against their backgrounds is compliant. For instance: ```css body { background-color: #ffffff; /* Ensure background is light */ color: #333333; /* Dark enough for contrast */ } ``` 4. **Form Labels**: Ensure that labels are always clearly associated with their respective input fields. The `for` attribute in labels must match the `id` of the inputs. **Code Suggestion**: ```html <label for=\\\\\\\"username\\\\\\\">Username</label> <input type=\\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\" id=\\\\\\\"username\\\\\\\" name=\\\\\\\"username\\\\\\\" /> ``` 5. **Interactive Elements' Hit Areas**: Review the size of interactive elements to ensure they meet the minimum target size of 44x44 pixels. **Code Suggestion**: ```css .button, .ast-button { min-width: 44px; /* Ensuring buttons are easily clickable */ min-height: 44px; } ``` 6. **Alt Text for Images**: Ensure that all images have descriptive alt text for screen readers. **Code Suggestion**: ```html <img src=\\\\\\\"image.jpg\\\\\\\" alt=\\\\\\\"Description of the image\\\\\\\"/> ``` Implementing these suggestions could improve the accessibility of the website significantly, increasing the score closer to 10.\",\n",

Add CSS if necessary. ```css button:focus { outline: 2px solid #0052cc; /* Add a focus style */ } ``` 4. **Color Contrast**: Validate color contrast for elements like the buttons. They should meet the minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 against their background. Example: If the button background is light and text is white, consider adjusting the color. ```css .mgbutton { background-color: #0052cc; /* Darken background for better contrast */ color: #ffffff; /* Ensure text is readable */ } ``` 5. **Text Content**: Make sure all interactive elements and complex areas (like cookie options) are clearly labeled, and consider using headings for sections to enhance structure for screen readers. ```html <h2>Cookie Settings</h2> ``` 6. **Modal Functionality**: Ensure that when the modal opens, focus is set to the modal, and when closed, focus returns to the element that triggered the modal. This can be done using JavaScript. ```javascript const modal = document.getElementById('moove_gdpr_cookie_modal'); modal.showModal(); modal.querySelector('button').focus(); // Focus on the first button in the modal ``` Implementing these improvements can enhance the accessibility and usability of the site for users with disabilities.\",\n",
