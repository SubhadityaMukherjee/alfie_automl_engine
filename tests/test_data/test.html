    <h1>Welcome to My Sample Page</h1>
    <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, formerly known as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), is an astronomical observatory in Chile. Its main task will be a synoptic[note 1] astronomical survey, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time.[2][3] The observatory is located on the El Peñón peak of Cerro Pachón, a 2,682-meter-high (8,799 ft) mountain in Coquimbo Region, in northern Chile, alongside the existing Gemini South and Southern Astrophysical Research Telescopes.[4] The LSST Base Facility is located about 100 kilometres (62 miles) away from the observatory by road, in the city of La Serena. The observatory is named for Vera Rubin, an American astronomer who pioneered discoveries about galactic rotation rates.

Vera C. Rubin Observatory is a joint initiative of the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science and is operated jointly by NSF NOIRLab and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.[5]

The Rubin Observatory houses the Simonyi Survey Telescope,[6] a wide-field reflecting telescope with an 8.4-meter primary mirror[7][8] that can photograph the entire available sky every few nights.[9] The telescope uses a novel three-mirror design, a variant of three-mirror anastigmat, which allows a compact telescope to deliver sharp images over a very wide 3.5-degree-diameter field of view. Images are recorded by a 3.2-gigapixel charge-coupled device imaging (CCD) camera, the largest digital camera ever constructed.[10]

The LSST was proposed in 2001, and construction of the mirror began (with private funds) in 2007. LSST then became the top-ranked large ground-based project in the 2010 Astrophysics Decadal Survey, and the project officially began construction on 1 August 2014, when the United States National Science Foundation (NSF) authorized the FY2014 portion ($27.5 million) of its construction budget.[11] Funding comes from the NSF, the United States Department of Energy, and private funding raised by the dedicated international non-profit organization, the LSST Discovery Alliance[12]. Operations are under the management of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA).[13] The total construction cost was expected to be about $680 million.[14]

Site construction began on 14 April 2015 with the ceremonial laying of the first stone.[15][16] The first on-sky observations with the engineering camera occurred on 24 October 2024,[17] while system first light images were released 23 June 2025.[18][19] Full survey operations are planned to begin later in 2025, due to COVID-related schedule delays.[20] LSST data is scheduled to become fully public after two years.[21] </p>

    <p> Technical geography is the branch of geography that involves using, studying, and creating tools to obtain, analyze, interpret, understand, and communicate spatial information.[1][2][3]

The other branches of geography, most commonly limited to human geography and physical geography, can usually apply the concepts and techniques of technical geography.[2][3][4] Nevertheless, the methods and theory are distinct, and a technical geographer may be more concerned with the technological and theoretical concepts than the nature of the data.[2][5] Further, a technical geographer may explore the relationship between the spatial technology and the end users to improve upon the technology and better understand the impact of the technology on human behavior.[6] Thus, the spatial data types a technical geographer employs may vary widely, including human and physical geography topics, with the common thread being the techniques and philosophies employed.[7][8] To accomplish this, technical geographers often create their own software or scripts, which can then be applied more broadly by others.[9] They may also explore applying techniques developed for one application to another unrelated topic, such as applying Kriging, originally developed for mining, to disciplines as diverse as real-estate prices.[10][11]

In teaching technical geography, instructors often need to fall back on examples from human and physical geography to explain the theoretical concepts.[12] While technical geography mostly works with quantitative data, the techniques and technology can be applied to qualitative geography, differentiating it from quantitative geography.[1] Within the branch of technical geography are the major and overlapping subbranches of geographic information science, geomatics, and geoinformatics.[2][13] </p>
