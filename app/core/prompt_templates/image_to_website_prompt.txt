Your job is to read the provided image and recreate it as a runnable website.

Requirements:
- Provide production-ready HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in your response.
- Preserve any text not only for the body but also the UI elements
- Recreate the layout, typography, colors, and interactions as faithfully as possible.
- Implement enough functionality to replicate the major visible interactions (e.g., nav hovers, buttons, simple forms).
- If the design suggests responsive behavior, include responsive CSS.
- Keep external dependencies minimal; prefer vanilla HTML/CSS/JS unless a framework is clearly implied.
- Include brief instructions at the end on how to run the site locally (e.g., open index.html, or run a static server).

Output format:
- Start with a short summary of the approach and assumptions.
- Then provide a single self-contained code listing with clear file separation comments, for example:
  <!-- index.html -->
  ...
  /* styles.css */
  ...
  // script.js
  ...
- Ensure all assets referenced are either embedded (data URIs) or explained how to substitute.
